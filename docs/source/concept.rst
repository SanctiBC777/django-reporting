And now, Let's explore the main components of Django Slick Reporting and what setting you can set on project level.

Components
----------


1. Result Field: represent a number, a calculation unit, for example: a Sum of a certain field.
   The report field identifies how the calculation should be done. ResultFields can depend on each other.

2. Generator: Represent a concrete report structure.If it would group by certain field, do a time series or a cross tab, and which columns (Report Field) to be calculated.
   It's also responsible for computing and provides low level access. *ie you can get the data in a list of dict/objects*

3. View: Responsible for creating a nice form to filter the report on, pass those filters to the generator class to create the report.
   It mimic the Generator API. Provide high level access. *You can hook it to your urls.py and you're all set, with the charts.*

4. Charting JS helpers: Django slick Reporting comes with highcharts and Charts js helpers libraries to plot the charts generated by the View
